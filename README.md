# Windows Auto

This executable will install some applications, open a port for RDP and join the machine to my network - Do not use the executables if you do not want to join my ZeroTier network.

You can change the PS scripts to suit your needs. This is why i made the repo public, to give inspiration ;)


## Application_Install_Script.ps1
Install applications like 7zip as the name suggests.

## ConvertToExe.ps1
Converts your script to a exe. Change the paths and remember to run as administrator.

## KMS_VL_ALL_AIO.cmd
Activates Windows (this is not my script)

## Remote_Desktop_Enable_Demo.ps1
Opens firewall ports for RDP.
